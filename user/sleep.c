/**
 * user process
 * ~ Before you start coding, read Chapter 1 of the xv6 book.
 * ~ Look at some of the other programs in user/ (e.g., user/echo.c, user/grep.c, and user/rm.c) to see how you can obtain the command-line arguments passed to a program.
 * ~ If the user forgets to pass an argument, sleep should print an error message.
 * ~ The command-line argument is passed as a string; you can convert it to an integer using atoi (see user/ulib.c).
 * ~ Use the system call sleep.
 * ~ See kernel/sysproc.c for the xv6 kernel code that implements the sleep system call (look for sys_sleep), user/user.h for the C definition of sleep callable from a user program, and user/usys.S for the assembler code that jumps from user code into the kernel for sleep.
 * ~ Make sure main calls exit() in order to exit your program.
 * ~ Add your sleep program to UPROGS in Makefile; once you've done that, make qemu will compile your program and you'll be able to run it from the xv6 shell.
 * ~ Look at Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C programming language (second edition) (K&R) to learn about C.
